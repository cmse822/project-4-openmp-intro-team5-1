Process 1 Threads: The lines with "from process: 1" are the output from the MPI process with rank 1. This process has spawned 4 OpenMP threads, and each thread prints its ID (0 to 3). The order in which these threads complete their execution and print the output can vary, which is why you see the thread IDs not in sequence (0, 2, 1, 3). This is a common characteristic of concurrent execution.

Process 0 Threads: Similarly, the lines with "from process: 0" are from the MPI process with rank 0. This process also has 4 threads, and they have printed their messages in a similarly mixed order (1, 2, 0, 3).
